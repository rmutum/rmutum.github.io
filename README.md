PROJECTS

===========================================================
Project # 1 - blockchain_erc721_permissioned_smart_contract
===========================================================
Creating an ERC-721 Token Standard Smart Contract and a Permissioned Blockchain Smart Contract

There are two parts to the project.

Part 1 is to create an ERC 721 Token Standard Smart Contract. This smart contract is to be developed with the Solidity programming language and Remix IDE and deployed to the Polygon Mumbai Testnet. Currently, the ERC-721 Token Standard is the most widely used non-fungible token standard in the Ethereum ecosystem. Fungibility means each token can be treated the same and interchangeably, in contrast to non-fungible tokens in which each token is unique, and distinct from other tokens. A smart contract on the Ethereum network is considered an ERC-721 Token smart contract if it implements the methods and events listed in the standard as required methods and events.

Part 2 is to create a Smart Contract for Permissioned Blockchain systems. This project uses the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain framework to create a device records management system. It allows users to add, update and query device records from a private blockchain ledger. Hyperledger Fabric is an open-source enterprise-grade private distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform, and the goal of this project is to understand, examine, build, and execute a smart contract that is useful for an enterprise.

ABSTRACT

Establishing proof of ownership and authenticity for digital assets has previously been a challenge in the digital world. NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, solve this problem. NFTs are distinct cryptographic tokens that exist on a blockchain and cannot be fraudulently replicated. NFTs can represent digital or real-world items like art, music, video, and real estate. Blockchain technology provides immutability of ownership and provenance records.

The Ethereum community uses Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) for proposing, debating, and implementing changes to the network. Among the types of EIPs are Ethereum Requests for Comments (ERCs) for application standards. One such standard, the ERC-721 Token standard, provides guidelines on how to create NFTs.

If anonymity is extremely important in buying and selling NFTs, and for that matter in any enterprise setting where the identities of participants are to be concealed and yet immutable records of the transactions are to be kept, then a permissioned blockchain is well suited for this purpose.

Hyperledger Fabric is a framework to implement permissioned blockchains. Permissioned blockchains provide an additional level of security over typical public blockchain systems by requiring an access control layer. Only trusted partners and invitees can participate. Permissioned blockchains are favored in enterprise settings where security, identity, roles, and access control are highly desired.

Project # 2 - smarthome_hand_gesture
====================================
USE CASE: The SmartHome Gesture Control Application showcases the possibility of using only hand gestures to control certain appliances and devices in a home with precision. Precision and most certainly safety are critical in controlling home appliances. In this POC, I use principles of mobile computing and leverage machine learning to recognize hand gestures that could be translated into remote commands to home appliances.

There are two parts of the project.

Part 1 is to build a mobile Android app using Android Studio and Java programming language. The app will capture five seconds long hand gesture videos. The videos are to be uploaded to a local server via a RESTful API.

Part 2 is to write a Python application that will use the uploaded videos from Part 1 to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and attempt to recognize gestures in a set of provided test videos via image recognitions.

The purpose of this project is to gain hands-on experience developing a mobile application that can capture videos of hand gestures and learn to apply principles of mobile computing and machine learning to recognize a hand gesture contained in a video using a pre-trained CNN machine learning model. The prediction by the model can then be used to actuate operations of appliances and devices in a smart home.

To keep it simple, for this project, the videos are only five seconds long. In a real-world situation, the video could be a streaming video and a hand gesture could be merely a human activity being performed by an inhabitant of a smart home during our daily lives. Monitoring daily activities of the inhabitants of a smart home, recognizing human activities in a home to offer home assistance services to improve quality of life, autonomy, and health of their residents, especially for elderly and dependent people will need massive computing power.

Project # 3 - facial_recognition
================================
Facial Recognition Examples

Example 1 (face_recognition_attendance) demonstrates facial recognition in a video stream. The code captures images from a video feed—typically from a webcam—and compares them against a database of known faces. When a face is detected, it checks if it matches a known individual. This setup could be used for tracking attendance. For instance, one webcam could be positioned to capture individuals entering a room, while another webcam captures those leaving. When a known face is detected, the individual can be marked as present. Conversely, when an unknown face is detected, it can be logged as a stranger or unidentified person.

Example 2 (face_recognition_of_hosts) is a simpler scenario that demonstrates face recognition in a static image. In this case, the target image contains 10 NBC hosts. However, only two hosts are stored in the "known hosts" folder. As a result, the code will recognize and identify these two hosts, while the remaining eight will be marked as unknown.
