## Projects

### Project 1: Blockchain ERC721 Permissioned Smart Contract
---
#### Overview
Creating an ERC-721 Token Standard Smart Contract and a Permissioned Blockchain Smart Contract

##### Part 1
Create an ERC 721 Token Standard Smart Contract using Solidity programming language and Remix IDE, deployed to the Polygon Mumbai Testnet.

##### Part 2
Create a Smart Contract for Permissioned Blockchain systems using Hyperledger Fabric blockchain framework.

#### Abstract
Establishing proof of ownership and authenticity for digital assets has previously been a challenge in the digital world. NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, solve this problem. NFTs are distinct cryptographic tokens that exist on a blockchain and cannot be fraudulently replicated. NFTs can represent digital or real-world items like art, music, video, and real estate. Blockchain technology provides immutability of ownership and provenance records.

### Project 2: SmartHome Hand Gesture
---
#### Use Case
The SmartHome Gesture Control Application showcases the possibility of using only hand gestures to control certain appliances and devices in a home with precision. Precision and most certainly safety are critical in controlling home appliances. This POC uses principles of mobile computing and leverages machine learning to recognize hand gestures that could be translated into remote commands to home appliances.

##### Part 1
Build a mobile Android app using Android Studio and Java programming language for capturing five seconds long hand gesture videos and uploading to a local server via RESTful API.

##### Part 2
Develop a Python application to use the uploaded videos to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for gesture recognition.

### Project 3: Facial Recognition
---
#### Example 1: Face Recognition Attendance
Demonstrates facial recognition in a video stream for tracking attendance using webcam feeds.

#### Example 2: Face Recognition of Hosts
Demonstrates face recognition in static images, specifically identifying NBC hosts from a database of known faces.

### Project 4: Agentic AI
---
#### Example 1: Build a chatbot with RAG
Demonstrates knowledge base in PDFs can be vectorized and embeddings used with RAG to empower an LLM.

#### Example 2: Build a chatbot with MCP
Demonstrates an LLM chatbot using tools (web services) with MCP.

#### Example 2: Build chatbots that communicate with Google's A2A
Demonstrates an LLM chatbot communicating with another AI agent with A2A.
